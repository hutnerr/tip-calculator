1. Make a Textbox component which is just my version of an EditText.
2. Make the Textbox observer interface and have Calculator implement it
3. Make the settings object and figure out how to store it
4. Load the calculator object defaults.
5. Determine if i need the View content inside of ElementContainer
6. I think I have alertObservers and notifyObservers in Slider and Calculator respectively.
7. Implement the Split UI
8. Make the Grid of Numbers and Calculator
9. Add a cursor pointer for where I'm typing
10. Use the strategy pattern for the UI of various ways of tip choices
11. I'm going to need a dropdown element
12. I'm also going to have to figure out an easy way to refresh the app on a change.


// I think I want to make a general Observer interface that I can use more easily.
// maybe with Generics

// I also want to keep my more generic design.
// So for the thing that implements the listen to slider interface, it should be a separate object
// because not all of them are going to want to listen to a slider in that way for example
// maybe SliderContainer or something

// I also want to extend EditText to make my own TextBox so I can create my own custom observers for that
// as well.
