## TipCalculator
A lightweight tip calculator app built to improve my software development skills. 
Built entirely in Java in Android Studio, it features a fully programmatic UI with no XML layouts. 

## Features
- **Rounding System**: Users can choose how the total after tip is rounded:
  - **Always Down**: rounds down (floor)
  - **Always Up**: rounds up (ceil)
  - **Dynamic**: rounds to the nearest integer
  - **None**: no rounding applied
- **Currency** support: Includes a few popular currencies
- **Themes**: Multiple preset themes available
- **Default Tip Percentage**: Set your preferred default tip
- **Bill Splitting**: Split the total evenly among a set number of people
