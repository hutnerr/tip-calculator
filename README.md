## Overview
A lightweight and Ad-free Android tip calculator built with a focus on flexibility, and everyday usability. 

Developed entirely in Java using Android Studio, the app features a fully programmatic UI with no XML layouts, allowing for precise control over layout and behavior.

This project was created as a hands-on way to strengthen Android development skills while building something practical, customizable, and easy to use.
