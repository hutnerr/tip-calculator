## Overview
A lightweight Android tip calculator built with a focus on flexibility, and everyday usability. 

Developed entirely in Java using Android Studio, the app features a fully programmatic UI with no XML layouts, allowing for precise control over layout and behavior.

This project was created as a hands-on way to strengthen Android development skills while building something practical, customizable, and easy to use.

## Features
- **Rounding System**: Users can choose how the total after tip is rounded:
  - **Always Down**: rounds down (floor)
  - **Always Up**: rounds up (ceil)
  - **Dynamic**: rounds up or down based on what is closer
  - **None**: no rounding applied
- **Currency Support**: Includes a few popular currencies
- **Themes**: Multiple preset themes available
- **Default Tip Percentage**: Set your preferred default tip
- **Bill Splitting**: Split the total evenly among up to 10 people
